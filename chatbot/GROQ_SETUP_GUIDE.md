```bash
# Run this in your chatbot directory:
conda run -n expense-chatbot streamlit run app.py
```

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… "Groq AI initialized successfully!" message
- ðŸ¤– Fast, intelligent responses about expenses
- ðŸŽ¯ Demographic-aware communication (student/professional/general)
- ðŸ“Š Integration with your expense data

## Step 4: Available AI Models in Your Chatbot

Your chatbot now supports multiple AI providers:

1. **Primary: Groq AI** (Fast & Free)
   - Model: Mixtral-8x7B-32768
   - Speed: ~500ms response time
   - Quality: Excellent for financial advice

2. **Fallback: IBM Watson** (Enterprise Grade)
   - Model: IBM Granite-3B-Code-Instruct  
   - Speed: ~2-3s response time
   - Quality: Specialized for business use

## Step 5: Testing Scenarios

Try these queries to test different user types:

### For Students:
- "Help me understand basic budgeting"
- "I need simple advice for managing my allowance"
- "Can you explain what a budget is?"

### For Professionals:
- "Analyze my quarterly expense reports"
- "What's the ROI on my business expenses?"
- "Help me optimize my departmental budget"

### General Users:
- "How can I save money on groceries?"
- "What are my biggest spending categories?"
- "Give me tips to reduce monthly expenses"

## Troubleshooting

### If Groq fails:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is correct
- System automatically falls back to IBM Watson

### If both AI services fail:
- Basic expense tracking still works
- Manual analysis features available
- Check your .env file configuration

## Next Steps

Once Groq is working:
1. Test the integrated chatbot widget in your React app
2. Try the standalone Streamlit chatbot
3. Experiment with different query types
4. Explore the expense analysis features
